title: Collection Hooks
description: Meteor Collection Hooks
---

Extends Mongo.Collection with `before`/`after` hooks for `insert`, `update`, `remove`, `find`, and `findOne`.

Works across client, server or a mix. Also works when a client initiates a collection method and the server runs the hook, all while respecting the collection validators (allow/deny).
