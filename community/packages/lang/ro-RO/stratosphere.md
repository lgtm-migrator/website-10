description: Meteor private package server

Stratosphere is a private package server for Meteor. So this is like Atmosphere on your own servers, with private packages.

Besides your own packages, Stratosphere will also give you access to all packages on Atmosphere.

At any time you can switch between package servers by setting an environment variable.
