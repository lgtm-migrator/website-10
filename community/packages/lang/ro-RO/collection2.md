description: Blaze Autoform and related packages

A Meteor package that allows you to attach a schema to a Mongo.Collection. Automatically validates against that schema when inserting and updating from client or server code.

This package requires the [simpl-schema NPM package](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js), which defines the schema syntax and provides the validation logic.
